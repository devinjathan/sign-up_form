# sign-up_form
*this project is WIP*

This project is a sign up page that can be used on other web pages.
This utilizes the form function on HTML and demonstrates my ability
to use it. This sign up page can be used as a skeleton for future webpages, but for now its just a practice project from TOP.

Tech Stack Used:
- HTML
- CSS

What I've learned:
In this, I've moved past fundementals and started utlizing more intermediate features such as em and rem for sizing purposes. This
is mostly used to be able for me to ensure my knowledge on using
the "form" function on HTML. The form function has much more to
learn about including its pseudo classes and case handling.

What to improve on:
- Accurate password verification
- cleaing up files for easier readability
- focus on learning more about units for em and such.
